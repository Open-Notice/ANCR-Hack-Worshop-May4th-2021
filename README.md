# OPN-R-Workshop-05-04-21

Every year on May 4th we hack a bit on data privacy and transparnecy.  This year is the first year we have international standards an enforceable privacy (which was the focus of all previous years).  

Intro - putting the language together (with standards and specs) 
April 22, 2021  - IIW - we led a session about being open about the providence of control over data, using standardized semantics for purpose specification and contextdual integrity that transcendes the digital divide. 

This year we plan an inro and 3 sessions 

Intro -
1. Privacy & Contract Interop - enhancing T&C's
2. Test and hack open public rights with the new standards and semantics. - testing performance
3. Apply new standards and semantics to issues around licenses 

Intro to cover
Notice & Data Control Semantics, a language for creating policy clauses for creqting and generating rights based notices, and measuring its performance. 
- we are creating a new language to enahce policy and trust fraemwork with rights based soviergn controls and open csource licensees that are true to people. 

This OCG-Kantara, Workshop is focused on further developing the policy and licensing framework that can utilize/implement a notice control language in the policy for licensening transparency and data control utilities (like non-fungible tokens) 

Key Topic :  development of an open source dual-multi entity type license lifecycle that is less exploitative and more innovative. 

History and Ongoing Activites: The Usual List
- Performance benchmarking privacy rights with notifications  
- A working session on a protocol for filing a Privacy Rights Requests and benchmarking its performance for transparency over 'children and youth surveillace' - Finish the Toronto Research (report) 
- A working session on claues for superceding T&C's and implmenting privacy rights in services - adding a privacy agreement to T&C's
- UNCL - adding UNCL in HTML Java, JSN LD, ASCII, to Phuscial signs - as paper receipts.  universifying human notice and controls.

How to protect our community from the perspective of big companies who benefit the most from open source?
How to assure that anyone (including big companies) would have a free access to the open source components and would be able to use it?
How to make sure that HCF would not become of the centralized entity to collect fees for all opens ource components?
How to assure that who ever is commercializing open source components that would bring the benefits to the community?
How to estimate costs of the license fee based on the size of the business and company?

Call out the T&C versus the Privacy framework flow and approach ..
- 911 poiicy - made this issue called FISA - which means T&C are not legal in other countriues and dont provide enough privacy and identiyt control in the US>

Topics
- Human Collosus Licenseing with UNCL
- OPN Broadcasting for Policy & License Frameworks for Purpose Driven Technology 
- UNCL - unified notice control language - using a single schema for dataa control notices and notifications,   that is usable internationally as a base schema to a address security and privacy requirements for data portability and control. 
- OPN use of UNCL  -via - ANCR, ToiP-T&C, W3C-DPV CG, spcified language using the ISO 29100, 29184, 27560 specifications. These are used to provide the tehcnical legal semantics for exising security policy and to implmenent localized privacy law. 
-  This common schema base is the basis for the proposed public notice and notification protocol called Consent by Desing. In which accountability transparency is centralzed and used to synconize a shared understanding of data control and consent. 
-  Also, usable as a public good, and is deisgned to provide meta data as a localized community data trust asset, enabling PPPP with  Consent Receipt Systems. 
- People's use of this framework to send an OPN  notice which embeds the legally required privacy and securty information so that it is r "provided" in an human operational manner before processing.  
- And to provide Individual's with human centric identity trust for data control and portability. 

Emerging topics
- Broadcasting Consent by Design: Consented Surveillance, Type of Surveillance, 
- (data trust governance interop)
 - privacy broadcasting  privacy policy clauses - 
 - privacy agreement with a transparency framework 
 - T&C privacy policy clauses for updating T&C's to implement a privacy agreement framework in a standard way
 - broadcasting Policy Clauses for enhancing privacy policies used for online Terms and Conditions - implementing a transparency supply chain with 0PN
 

 OPN Broadcasting Policy & Clause
 - Privacy Policy for OPN
 - Privacy Assurance Framework
 
 
 Requirements 
-  open and used for people to see and control their data with privacy rights and controls which are human centric.  Designed for people to control and see   surveillance capitalism in action.
