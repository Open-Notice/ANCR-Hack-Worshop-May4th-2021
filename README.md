# OPN-R-Workshop-05-04-21
0PN mission - online public notice (transaprency broadcast) of who (what legal entity and accountable person) controls personal infrmation, and what rule book they have for surveillance/use etc of identifiers.   OPN is a Consent Receipt system which uses consent receipts to remeber digital identity relationships for people, so that the same notice doesnt have to be constantly repeated (once a proof of notice receipt is provided).  

OPN signalling is designed to only generate notices if there is a change in the state of datal control and transparnecy which must be presented, and notarized in the OPN Public Notice Ledger. (in order to decentralize data governance) 

This OPN Workshop is focused on further developing the policy and licensing framework that can utilize/implement a notice control language in the policy for licensening transparency and utility. 

Notice Control Semantics, as a language for creating policy clauses for enhancing and linking privacy policies and licenses to processing contexts. 
This UNCL should support the development of an open source dual-multi entity type license lifecycle that is less exploitative and more innovative. 

- The framework for OPN is a Code of Conduct is to be open about who is incontrol and accountable for processing personal information before you process or at a minimum at the time of processing. 
- for measuring Transparency Risk and a specific set of practices for measuring the performance of a Notice.  

Topics
- OPN Broadcasting for Policy & License Frameworks for Purpose Driven Technology 
- UNCL - unified notice control language - using a single schema for dataa control notices and notifications,   that is usable internationally as a base schema to a address security and privacy requirements for data portability and control. 
- OPN use of UNCL  -via - ANCR, ToiP-T&C, W3C-DPV CG, spcified language using the ISO 29100, 29184, 27560 specifications. These are used to provide the tehcnical legal semantics for exising security policy and to implmenent localized privacy law. 
-  This common schema base is the basis for the proposed public notice and notification protocol called Consent by Desing. In which accountability transparency is centralzed and used to synconize a shared understanding of data control and consent. 
-  Also, usable as a public good, and is deisgned to provide meta data as a localized community data trust asset, enabling PPPP with  Consent Receipt Systems. 
- People's use of this framework to send an OPN  notice which embeds the legally required privacy and securty information so that it is r "provided" in an human operational manner before processing.  
- And to provide Individual's with human centric identity trust for data control and portability. 

Requirements 
-  open and used for people to see and control their data with privacy rights and controls which are human centric.  Designed for people to control and see   surveillance capitalism in action. 


Ongoing Activites: The Usual List
- Performance benchmarking Use Case - 
- A working session on a protocol for filing a Privacy Rights Requests and benchmarking its performance for transparency over 'children and youth surveillace'
- A working session on claues for superceding T&C's and implmenting privacy rights in services 

Emerging topics
- Broadcasting Consent by Design: Consented Surveillance, Type of Surveillance, 
- (data trust governance interop)
 - privacy broadcasting  privacy policy clauses - 
 - privacy agreement with a transparency framework 
 - T&C privacy policy clauses for updating T&C's to implement a privacy agreement framework in a standard way
 - broadcasting Policy Clauses for enhancing privacy policies used for online Terms and Conditions - implementing a transparency supply chain with 0PN

How to protect our community from the perspective of big companies who benefit the most from open source?
How to assure that anyone (including big companies) would have a free access to the open source components and would be able to use it?
How to make sure that HCF would not become of the centralized entity to collect fees for all opens ource components?
How to assure that who ever is commercializing open source components that would bring the benefits to the community?
How to estimate costs of the license fee based on the size of the business and company?

Call out the T&C versus the Privacy framework flow and approach ..
- 911 poiicy - made this issue called FISA - which means T&C are not legal in other countriues and dont provide enough privacy and identiyt control in the US>
